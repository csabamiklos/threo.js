<p>
This file is intended to be a demonstration of the many excellent capabilities of the three.js cylinder primitive. The issue is that the capping or closing of the bottom end of cylinder appears to not be completing correctly.</p>

<p>The demo shows a range cylinders with from three to eight sides. Using the mousewheel or touchpad scrolling, it is possible to zoom from one side of the "wall" of cylinders to the other side. To help remind you which side is which there is a red cube on one side and a green cube on the other.<p>

<p>You will note that it is the end of the cylinders on the red side that appear to be capping improperly. The source code contains commented out lines that, if turned on, pernit you to view the cylinders as solids instead of wireframes.</p>
