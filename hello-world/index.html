This is Three.js at its simplest most basic level - just a cube on a white background angled so you can see it is a 3D object. This is the same code as the Cube primitive sample code with most the comments taken out.</p>

<p><a href="three-js-hello-world-view.html">Hello World View</a><br>
This sample adds one feature: the ability to rotate the cube using the pointing device. It's actually quite a significant feature in that it adds animation. Have a look at the setInterval that calls the loop function which in turn rotates the camera. Also look for the capture of the mouse events. </p>

<p><a href="three-js-hello-world-view-zoom.html">Hello World View Zoom</a><br>
The extra feature in this file is the ability to zoom using the scrolling of the mouse or touchpad. All it takes is adding another addEventListener and a two line function. This is easy!</p>

The animation is nice, but what we're looking at is pretty boring. Let's lighten up a bit. We'll add a light - and animate it as well. Here's the thing: adding lights can become a really tricky and time consuming business. Here's a useful tip: Add a light that moves with the camera. That way you'll never be in the dark.  ;-)</p>

<p><b>*** <i><a href="three-js-hello-world-extreme.html">Hello World Extreme</a></i> *** Extra Bonus Feature!!!</b><br>
How small is the smallest possible three.js file that clearly show a 3D object? Believe it or not, the answer is 346 characters small. It's so small it almost fits into our tiny brain.</p>

<p>We dare and challenge you to do better! Please link to the same souce file. Also the camera position should be non-orthogonal - so everybody can see the object is 3D.</p>

<p>Oh, by the way, if you try to use a shorter variable than "scene" the cube will not display. This looks like a possible bug - unless it's a feature we don't know about.</p>

<p>If you do come up with a sweeter solution please post a link on <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/threejs/" target="_blank">reddit.com/r/threejs</a></p>

<p>2011-05-09: Fixed all the demos. Added "THREE." in front of all the primitives to comply with revised Three.js</p>
