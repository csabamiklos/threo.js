<p>The following demos are built on top of <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js#readme" target="_blank">three.js</a> which is a lightweight 3D engine working over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL" target="_blank">WebGL</a> that is "with a very low level of abstraction (aka for dummies)". All I can say is "Works for me!"</p>

<p>The demos were created on top of the shortest, tightest "hello world" applet for three.js that I have been able to come up with so far. My guess/hope is that if they were minified that each would be less that 1,000 bytes - not including the three-js files or the texture images.</p>

<p>Because of their tightness these files contain warning that you need a browser that supports WebGL. Currently Internet Explorer does not support WbGL. Best to use Google Chrome or the beta version for FireFox 4.</p>

<p>You will need a fast, recently made computer with a good graphics card in order to view these demos. Before too long I will build version that will ask you for the amount of complexity to display before the demos begin.</p>

<p>One could say that these demos are somewhat "cubist" oriented. And that may be a fair comment. In 1906 Pablo Picasso tried to show that artists could do more and better than still or even movie cameras. Perhaps in the animated processing of the 1200 images in each demo there is a feeling of having more than enough cameras.</p>

<p>An interesting aspect of the demos is that each one has quite a different feeling to it. Yet tecnically all the demos run the same code at the same speed.</p>
