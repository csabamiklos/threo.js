<h2><a href="examples/index.html">Coding Samples</a></h2>

<p>The Coding Samples files are intended to help you learn how to write code for three,js. Each file provides the simplest and minimum possible code needed to carry out a single intended result. The goal is to get the information as to how to create or dp something into your brain in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h2><a href="cynthia/index.html">Coding Demos</a></h2>

<p>The Demo Files are intended to show off cool things you can do using three.js.  Each file provides a demo. The goal is to get you to think "Wow, I've come to the right place. This is just what I need!" (or to think the opposite as the case may be) in the shortest time.</p>

<p>The current demos involve wrapping images around swirling cubes. The images are of my second daughter and three of her drawings.</p>

<p>All the files are built on top of <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js#readme" target="_blank">three.js</a> which is a lightweight 3D engine working over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL" target="_blank">WebGL</a> that is "with a very low level of abstraction (aka for dummies)". All I can say is "Works for me!"</p>

<p>Because of their tightness these files do <b>not</b> contain a warning that you need a browser that supports WebGL. Currently Internet Explorer does not support WebGL. Best to use Google Chrome or the beta versions of  FireFox 4 and Safari 10.6 .</p>
