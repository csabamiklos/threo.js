<h1>example files for three.js</h1>

<p><i>Standing on the shoulders of mrdoob...</i></p>

<p><a href="three-js-example-primitives-4-cube.html">Cube Primitive</a></p>

<p><a href="three-js-example-primitives-4-cylinder.html">Cylinder Primitive</a></p>

<p><a href="three-js-example-primitives-4-primitives.html">The Four Primities used in One file</a></p>

<p>The following demos are built on top of <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js#readme" target="_blank">three.js</a> which is a lightweight 3D engine working over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL" target="_blank">WebGL</a> that is "with a very low level of abstraction (aka for dummies)". All I can say is "Works for me!"</p>

<p>The demos were created on top of the shortest, tightest "hello world" applet for three.js that I have been able to come up with so far. My guess/hope is that if they were minified that each would be less that 1,000 bytes - not including the three-js files or the texture images.</p>

<p>Because of their tightness these files contain warning that you need a browser that supports WebGL. Currently Internet Explorer does not support WbGL. Best to use Google Chrome or the beta version for FireFox 4.</p>

<p>You will need a fast, recently made computer with a good graphics card in order to view these demos. Before too long I will build version that will ask you for the amount of complexity to display before the demos begin.</p>
