<h1>example files for three.js</h1>

<p><a href="three-js-example-primitives-cube.html">Cube Primitive</a></p>

<p><a href="three-js-example-primitives-cylinder.html">Cylinder Primitive</a></p>

<p><a href="three-js-example-primitives-plane.html">Plan Primitive</a></p>

<p><a href="three-js-example-primitives-sphere.html">Sphere Primitive</a></p>

<p><a href="three-js-example-primitives-4-primitives.html">The Four Primities used in One file</a></p>

<p>These codimg samples are built on top of <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js#readme" target="_blank">three.js</a> which is a lightweight 3D engine working over <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebGL" target="_blank">WebGL</a>.</p>

<p>The samples were created on top of the shortest, tightest "hello world" applet for three.js that I have been able to come up with so far. See <p><a href="three-js-example-primitives-cube.html">Cube Primitive</a></p> for an example. My guess/hope is that if they were minified that each would be less that 1,000 bytes - not including the three-js files or the texture images.</p>

<p>Because of their tightness these files do <b>not</b> contain a warning that you need a browser that supports WebGL. Currently Internet Explorer does not support WbGL. Best to use Google Chrome or the beta versions of  FireFox 4 and Safari 10.6 .</p>
