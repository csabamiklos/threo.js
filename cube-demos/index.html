A demo file that incorporates Three.js textures created using binary images that have bee re-encoded as base64 strings. This allows the image data to be hosted on a different server than the master HTML file.

This demo uses WebGLrenderer2. There's ten thousand cubes all rotating in real-time. It's faster. Is it ten times faaster? Or more? I'm not sure and I don't really care. I can now manipulate more objects than my tiny brain could possibly deal with (in the near future anyway).

<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>2011-02-03: A couple of what I thought were minor tweaks and now the code loads in a few seconds and runs fast. This is fun!</p>

<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>Here is a demo that will bring your computer to its knees. One thousand partially-transparent Phong-shaded red cubes all twirling in different directions as the camera swirls around. Allow a good minute or so just for the demo to load.</p>

<P>Once I've got the hang of particles and shaders and all the good stuff that's coming out of three.js and WebGL, I'm sure I'll look back at this demo with a sheepish smile. But coming from that old world of using AutoLISP and AutoCAD to translate vector geometry this is all a breath of fresh air combined with magic combined with DIY rocket science.</p>
